## 📖 Project Description

**HCL GUVI – AI-Powered Audio Scam Analyzer** is an intelligent system designed to detect financial and social-engineering scams from recorded phone calls. The application analyzes audio conversations using **speech-to-text**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, **emotion analysis**, and **pattern detection** to assess whether a call is likely to be fraudulent.

The system processes audio inputs, converts speech into text, extracts key entities and scam-related phrases, analyzes emotional pressure such as urgency or fear, and finally generates a **risk score** indicating the likelihood of a scam. This helps users and organizations identify suspicious calls early and take preventive action.

The project follows a **modular backend architecture** with clearly separated services for audio processing, analysis, and scoring, along with a simple frontend interface. It is built to be **scalable, extensible, and hackathon-ready**, making it suitable for real-world fraud prevention use cases.
