## 📞 Demo Call Script

**Judge:** "How is your system better than competitors?"

**You:** "Most systems only analyze transcribed text and do keyword matching. We go much deeper:

1. We analyze the VOICE itself - scammers might have a perfect script, but they show stress in their voice through speaking rate and pitch variation.

2. We detect psychological manipulation - we understand the tactics used in social engineering attacks, not just keywords.

3. We extract ENTITIES - we know what sensitive information they're trying to steal, showing their intent.

4. We recognize known SCAM CAMPAIGNS - we maintain a database of 8 real Indian fraud patterns and give instant recognition.

This multi-layer approach means all our analysis types confirm each other, preventing false positives while catching real scams. A professional approach, not just keyword matching."
